TensorBored is a suite of web applications for inspecting and understanding
your training runs and graphs, with a focus on PyTorch compatibility.

This is a fork of TensorBoard. Install with ``pip install tensorbored``.

For PyTorch projects, use ``from tensorbored.torch import SummaryWriter`` —
a drop-in replacement that removes the need to install the original
``tensorboard`` package.
