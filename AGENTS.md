# TensorBored - Agent Guidelines

This file has been split into two documents for clarity:

- **[AGENTS_DEV.md](./AGENTS_DEV.md)** — For agents working **on** the TensorBored codebase (architecture, state management, build system, CI/CD, coding patterns).
- **[AGENTS_DOC.md](./AGENTS_DOC.md)** — For agents that want to **use** TensorBored (installation, features, Python API, examples, integration guide).
